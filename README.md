- Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.
- Create a new branch called workflow.
- Configure the project with eslint, prettier and commit hooks.
- Configure the project with GitHub Actions for build/deploy if required.
- Record any bugs found during this process in the Issues tab.
- Configure the project for Jest and Cypress.
- Create tests to cover the required test cases.
- Create a Pull Request from workflow into the default branch.
- Request a review from your peers to help improve your submission.
- Make any final changes based on this feedback.
